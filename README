Locale-CLDR

Please note that this code requires Perl 5.18 and above

The general overview of the project is to convert the XML of the CLDR into a large number of small Perl
modules that can be loaded from the main Local::CLDR when needed to do what ever localisation is required.

Note that the API is not yet fixed. I'll try and keep things that have tests stable but any thing else 
is at your own risk.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

The installation comes with the mkcldr.pl script which I use to download the
latest CLDR data file and process the data.
